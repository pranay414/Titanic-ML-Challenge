# Titanic-ML-Challenge
Using Machine Learning to predict what sorts of people are likely to survive

## About
* I used different types of classifiers like `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest` and `Gradient Boosting`. 
* The `Gradient Boosting` classifier gave an accuracy of 82.01%. 
* I also preprocessed the datset and removed unwanted features like `name`, `ticket`, `home.dest`, `body`, `cabin`, `boat`.
* I used `cross-validation` to improve the performance of my model.

## Packages Used
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
